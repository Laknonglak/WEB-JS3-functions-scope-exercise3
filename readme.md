# JS-03 Declare and Use Functions

 <br/>
 <br/>

Before each exercise, make sure you think about the 4 steps of a function.

```
1. Understand the purpose of the function.
2. Define the data that comes into the function from the caller (in the form of parameters)!
3. Define what data variables are needed inside the function to accomplish its goal.
4. Decide the set of steps that the program will use to accomplish this goal (the algorithm).
```

Start coding up your answer once you have completed step 4.

### Exercise #3.1

Maria has to calculate the cost of her payments for the month. For every transation there is a $3 fee and a 0.1% (0.001) interest fee.

#### Part 2

Ed would like to create a function that takes in a birth year and returns the age.

i.e. 1990 returns 30

#### Part 3

`Welcome {name1}, you are {age1}. Welcome {name2}, you are {age2}. Welcome {name3}, you are {age3}.`

### Challenge Yourself

A teacher wants to create a rubric for grading. The rubric is from 0 - 11.

#### Part 1

A student passes if they have a score greater than or equal to 5.
Create a function that returns a boolean true or false.

#### Part 2

A student has an excellent grade if they score higher than 8.
Add on to your function to print out "Excellent" for scores greater than 8.

#### Part 3

A student has a perfect grade if their score is 11.
